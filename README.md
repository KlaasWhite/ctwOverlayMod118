# ctwOverlayMod118
A mod to work with an obs overlay to show the teams and classes for blebi's Capture the wool

# Installation
Download the mod from https://github.com/KlaasWhite/ctwOverlayMod118/releases/tag/Releases
Install the mod with fabric version 1.18.1

# Utilisiation
When in game, the gui can be accessed with a set button (changeable in the controls settings)

The url should be set to https://ctwoverlay.herokuapp.com but that should be automatic

Before connecting the "ctw mode" can be set, this sets if the game displays and checks for ctw classes


Now the overlay can be accesed in obs on the url https://ctwoverlay.herokuapp.com/overlay/<your ingame name>

The updates are automatic but the server is hosted in a container that shuts of after a bit

So if the classes and teams are not updating, refresh the browser source

# Utilisation license
This mod is fully free to use
Please do not spam the server tho, I dont want an insane bill hryLaf
I appreciate if you shout out my work but I do not require this
